Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at **IEETA, University of Aveiro** (defending Q1 2026). My research focuses on **Information Retrieval** and **Semantic Search**, bridging **Large Language Models** with **Knowledge Graphs** to improve how systems access and organize data.

I develop **Open Information Extraction** algorithms for lower-resource languages, primarily European Portuguese, and explore **RAG architectures** leveraging structured knowledge to enhance retrieval.

I've secured $25k in competitive funding from **Google & RNCA** and published at **ACL Workshops** and **LREC**. I'm now transitioning to industry to build production-ready systems that make AI more accessible for low-resource languages.

**Core expertise:** OpenIE, NER, Graph Neural Networks, and LLMs. Experienced working with cross-functional and international research teams.

Seeking full-time roles as an **Applied Scientist**, **LLM Engineer**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, or similar positions where I can apply my expertise in ML and NLP.
