I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate (defending First Quarter of 2026) and Researcher at **IEETA, University of Aveiro** specializing in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Graph Machine Learning**. 

I specialize in **Information Retrieval** and **Semantic Search**. My work explores the intersection of **Large Language Models** and **Knowledge Graphs** to improve how systems access and organize data. I focus on developing **Open Information Extraction** algorithms for lower-resource languages, with a main focus on European Portuguese. Currently I am interested in exploring **RAG architectures** where structured knowledge enhances the retrieval process, ensuring that generated outputs are grounded in relevant, retrieved context.

### From Research to Production
After years of academic research—including securing competitive funding from **Google & RNCA** and publishing in top-tier venues like **ACL Workshops** and **LREC**—I am transitioning to industry to apply these techniques at scale in a way that can make a positive impact in the lives of people.

In my limited free time, I am experimenting building different RAG systems for personal applications (mostly Table-Top RPG focused) and exploring different LLMs. 

### What I Bring to the Table

*   **Advanced NLP & Graph ML:** Expertise in Open Information Extraction (OpenIE), Named Entity Recognition (NER), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and LLMs (Large Language Models).
*   **RAG Engineering:** Proven ability to merge unstructured text with structured ontologies to improve information retrieval and generation.
*   **Proven Problem Solving:** Awarded around 250000$ in computing and a grade of **9.22/10** by the RNCA/Google Advanced Computing panel for my project proposal on Graph-based Information Extraction.
*   **Collaboration:** Experienced in working with cross-functional teams (from Chemistry to Tourism) and international research groups (Linköping University, Sweden).

### Looking Ahead
I am actively seeking full-time roles as an **Applied Scientist**, **LLM Engineer**, **Machine Learning Engineer** or anything related to my passions. I am eager to join a team where I can leverage my background in semantic technologies to build AI products that impact the lives of millions.
